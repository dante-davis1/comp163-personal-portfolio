Academic Wellness Tracker is a branching simulation game that models the academic and personal choices of a college student over a semester. You play as yourself, navigating course loads, study strategies, and stress management to reach one of several outcomes.

The game explores the balance between academic performance and personal wellness. It challenges players to make thoughtful decisions about course intensity and 
study focus while managing stress and social engagement.

- Conditional Logic: Course load and study choices affect GPA, stress, and social points based on thresholds.
- Nested Decisions: Final outcomes depend on combinations of GPA, study hours, and stress level.
- Type Checking: Ensures GPA and study hours are valid before calculating outcomes.
- Multiple Endings: Reflect different academic and wellness paths based on player input.

 How to Run the Game
- Open the Python file in any IDE or terminal.
- Run the script.
- Follow the prompts to choose your course load and study focus.
- View your final stats and outcome

The good endings reflect strong academic performance, balanced study habits, and manageable stressâ€”showing you're either thriving or steadily progressing. The bad endings highlight burnout, academic risk, or imbalance, signaling a need for support, recovery, or a shift in priorities.
